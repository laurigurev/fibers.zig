fibers.zig

Personal project inspired by 'Fibers, Oh My!' and 'Parallelizing the Naughty Dog
engine using fibers'. Allows for context switching and multithreading with 
custom synchronization primitives. Developed on x64 Windows 11, and should not 
work on any other platform or architecture since context switching involves 
assembly and OS structures and sychronization involvolves compiler/memory barriers. 
And error handling is non-existant.

Current status: WORKING. Should you use it: NO, since I only tested on one simple 
case. 

Wait list keeps track of thread ids and each context is allowed to run on one 
specific thread. Underscore functions are assembly only functions. They are
separated from main body because we don't want to handle function 
prologue/epilogue when copying contexts aroun when copying contexts around.

You are free to use this project how ever you want. Just note that this project 
is archieved and it will not be updated.

Last compiled with Zig v0.12.0-dev.3533+e5d900268. No external dependencies beyond 
what zig compiler links on default.
